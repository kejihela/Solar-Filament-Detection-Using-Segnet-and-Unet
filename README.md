# Solar-Filament-Detection-Using-Segnet-and-Unet

Some of the most recognizable characteristics of the sun are solar filaments. It is used to forecast geomagnetic storms in addition to space weather investigations. There are numerous ways to find solar filaments, however the majority of them require manually identifying traits. This study uses deep learning to demonstrate automated ways for finding solar filaments in H full-disk solar pictures. This technique would precisely identify filaments and reduce the impact of solar noise spots. A threshold and region growing combined approach, an artificial neural network technique, and automated region growing techniques and procedures are all available (ANN). The investigation would involve using a dataset with solid technical properties that might be utilized to train an autonomous filament detection.

# Receiver Operating Curve
This research adopts a system-centered methodology. It is demonstrated that the impact of various region-based segmentation algorithms on the effectiveness of classification algorithms can be assessed using a  receiver operating characteristic, which also takes into account the intrinsic uncertainty present. The findings produced for a solar filament detection uses this method illustrate the non-linear relationship between the constituent algorithms and statistically demonstrate how the performance of the system can be significantly classified.
